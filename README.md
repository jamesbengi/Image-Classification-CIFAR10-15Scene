# Image Classification using CIFAR-10 and 15 Scene Datasets

## Overview
This repository contains an image classification project using the CIFAR-10 and 15 Scene datasets. The goal is to develop and evaluate deep learning models capable of accurately classifying images from these two datasets.

## Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **15 Scene**: A dataset consisting of 4485 images of 15 natural scene categories, widely used for scene classification tasks.
