# Image Classification using CIFAR-10 and 15 Scene Datasets

## Overview
An image classification project utilizing convolutional neural networks to classify images from the CIFAR-10 and 15 Scene datasets. This initiative aims to create and assess deep learning models that can accurately classify images from these two diverse datasets

## Datasets
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **15 Scene**: A dataset consisting of 4485 images of 15 natural scene categories, widely used for scene classification tasks.
